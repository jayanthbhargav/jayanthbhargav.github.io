    <p> We study the problem of sensor scheduling for an intrusion detection task. We model this as a 2-player zero-sum game over a graph, 
      where the defender (Player 1) seeks to identify the optimal sensor scheduling strategy to minimize the probability of missed detection 
      at minimal cost, while the intruder (Player 2) aims to identify the optimal path selection strategy to maximize missed detection probability 
      at minimal cost. The defenderâ€™s strategy space grows exponentially with the number of sensors, making direct computation of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) 
      strategies computationally expensive. To tackle this, we propose a distributed variant of the Weighted Majority algorithm that exploits the structure 
      of the game's payoff matrix, enabling efficient computation of the NE strategies with provable convergence guarantees. Next, we consider a more 
      challenging scenario where the defender lacks knowledge of the true sensor models and, consequently, the game's payoff matrix. For this setting, 
      we develop online learning algorithms that leverage bandit feedback from sensors to estimate the NE strategies. By building on existing results 
      from  perturbation theory and online learning in matrix games, we derive high-probability order optimal regret bounds for our algorithms. 
      Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms in both known and unknown payoff scenarios. </p>

    <p> Representation learning plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning, especially in complex environments with high-dimensional and 
      unstructured states. Effective representations can enhance the efficiency of learning algorithms by improving sample efficiency and 
      generalization across tasks. This paper considers the Laplacian-based framework for representation learning, where the eigenvectors of the 
      Laplacian matrix of the underlying transition graph are leveraged to encode meaningful features from raw sensory observations of the states. 
      Despite the promising algorithmic advances in this framework, it remains an open question whether the Laplacian-based representations can be 
      learned online and with theoretical guarantees along with policy learning. To answer this question, we study online Laplacian-based representation 
      learning, where the graph-based representation is updated simultaneously while the policy is updated by the reinforcement learning algorithm. We 
      design an online optimization formulation by introducing the Asymmetric Graph Drawing Objective (AGDO) and provide a theoretical analysis of the 
      convergence of running online projected gradient descent on AGDO under mild assumptions. Specifically, we show that if the policy learning algorithm 
      induces a bounded drift on the policy, running online projected gradient descent on AGDO exhibits ergodic convergence. Our extensive simulation studies 
      empirically validate the guarantees of convergence to the true Laplacian representation. 
      Furthermore, we provide insights into the compatibility of different reinforcement learning algorithms with online representation learning. </p>

    <p> We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, 
      where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations 
      from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables 
      non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, 
      we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under 
      a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature 
      properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we 
      highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric 
      to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for 
      optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in

    <p> Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) 
      can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables. The state space, action space and reward function of a fMDP can be 
      encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider the setting where we have a set of potential sensors 
      to select for the fMDP (at design-time), where each sensor measures a certain state variable and has a selection cost. We formulate 
      the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors for fMDPs (subject to certain budget constraints) to maximize the expected infinite-horizon 
      discounted return provided by the optimal control policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this optimization 
      problem to within any non-trivial factor. We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the 
      expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial 
      factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems 
      and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite the inapproximability results, through extensive 
      simulations, we show that the greedy algorithm may provide near-optimal performance for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and 
      randomly generated fMDP instances. </p>

    <p> We consider the problem of selecting an optimal subset of information sources for a hypothesis testing/classification 
    task where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses, based on finite observation 
    samples from the sources. In order to characterize the learning performance, we propose a misclassification penalty framework, 
    which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification errors. In a centralized Bayesian learning setting, we study 
    two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of 
    misclassifying the true hypothesis remains bounded and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited budget to minimize 
    the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of 
    these combinatorial optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability performance guarantees 
    for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of 
    misclassification. We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for the greedy algorithms for 
    both the information set selection problems. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results over several 
    randomly generated instances. </p>

    <p>Mixed-Observable Markov Decision Processes (MOMDPs) are used to model systems where the state space can be decomposed as a product space of a set of state variables, 
      and the controlling agent is able to measure only a subset of those state variables. In this paper, we consider the setting where we have a set of potential sensors to 
      select for the MOMDP, where each sensor measures a certain state variable and has a selection cost. We formulate the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors for MOMDPs 
      (subject to certain budget constraints) to maximize the expected infinite-horizon reward of the agent and show that this sensor placement problem is NP-Hard, even when one has 
      access to an oracle that can compute the optimal policy for any given instance. We then study a greedy algorithm for approximate optimization and show that there exist instances 
      of the MOMDP sensor selection problem where the greedy algorithm can perform arbitrarily poorly. Finally, we provide some empirical results of greedy sensor selection over 
      randomly generated MOMDP instances and show that, in practice, the greedy algorithm provides near-optimal solutions for many cases, despite the fact that one cannot provide 
      general theoretical guarantees for its performance. In total, our work establishes fundamental complexity results for the problem of optimal sensor selection

    <p>Planning an accurate and safe trajectory is a crucial element in autonomous driving. To execute complex driving maneuvers like overtaking, 
      motion planning requires an enhanced decision-making algorithm that decides the when, where and how of the overtaking maneuver. 
      This paper proposes an algorithm that increases the likelihood of a safe overtaking maneuver by 
      learning spatial information. Here, spatial information refers to the track portion/curve and the position of the ego vehicle with reference to that. 
      The technique is applied to an autonomous racing setup where vehicles have to detect and operate at the limits of dynamic handling. 
      To learn the spatial information, offline experiments of a 2-player race are conducted to generate probability distributions of overtaking maneuvers 
      conditioned on speed and relative-position of the ego vehicle with respect to the opponent. 
      Furthermore, a Switched Model Predictive Contouring Controller (SMPCC) is proposed for incorporating the policy learning algorithm into the path planning 
      and control setup. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve an increased number of overtakes at different track portions
      on known and unknown race tracks. </p>

    <p>The rising popularity of driver-less cars has led
to the research and development in the field of autonomous
racing, and overtaking in autonomous racing is a challenging
task. Vehicles have to detect and operate at the limits of dynamic
handling and decisions in the car have to be made at high
speeds and high acceleration. One of the most crucial parts in
autonomous racing is path planning and decision making for an
overtaking maneuver with a dynamic opponent vehicle. In this
paper we present the evaluation of a track based offline policy
learning approach for autonomous racing. We define specific
track portions and conduct offline experiments to evaluate the
probability of an overtaking maneuver based on speed and
position of the ego vehicle. Based on these experiments we can
define overtaking probability distributions for each of the track
portions. Further, we propose a switching MPCC controller setup
for incorporating the learnt policies to achieve a higher rate
of overtaking maneuvers. By exhaustive simulations, we show
that our proposed algorithm is able to increase the number of
overtakes at different track portions. </p>

Developing countries like India have undertaken Green Energy Transition to ensure sustainability and energy self-sufficiency. The increase in consumer participation in view of the nation's goal necessitates technology advancements in condition monitoring of PV systems. As of today, state of art and robust monitoring systems are available and deployed for large solar farms and have proved to increase the operational efficiency of those systems, whereas there are no standard monitoring systems for small-scale installations.

    <p> Stand-alone PV systems are increasingly becoming popular as a viable alternative to utility power supply, especially in remote corners, where accessibility is a problem to deploy conventional distribution systems. It is also becoming a choice of conscious consumers who wish to contribute to environment protection through use of green energy. In this context, it is vital to have a fault diagnosis system in place to identify various faults in the PV system. This paper presents a signature analysis of various electrical faults in a stand-alone PV system, with battery storage. The focus of the work is to minimize the sensors to be deployed for detection and classification of the faults.

    <p> Micro controller contains one or more processor cores along with peripheral devices and memory. Micro-controllers find extensive use in embedded system applications such as automobile engine control systems, bio-medical devices, electronic appliances, etc. They are specific to a particular task, are small and compact in size, and consume less power; all of these features have resulted in the ubiquitous deployment of micro-controllers in various devices. However, it must be noted that a microcontroller is a Control Circuit, and not a Driving Circuit. This statement is supported by the fact that the output current of a microcontroller is too small to drive a motor connected to it directly; in fact, this is an unpropitious experiment and can damage the microcontroller. The microcontroller controls the working of actuators connected to it by following the logic coded onto it, and in this sense, forms the very brain of the embedded system. But in order to drive the motor, we need a type of switch (MOSFET, Relay, etc.) which can take the small output current of the microcontroller and control the power source to the motor. Essentially, a microcontroller accepts real-time inputs and generates an output control signal as per the rules and predefined logical deductions, in the prescribed algorithm. This paper discusses the criterion one must consider for the choice of an embedded system from the plethora of systems available in the market and the choice of control technique for different robotic applications.</p>      </span>

      This paper aims to develop and validate an empirical model to quantify the impact of partial shading on photovoltaic (PV) panel performance. 
      Partial shading, a significant challenge in solar power generation, can drastically reduce energy output, yet predicting its effects remains difficult 
      using conventional models. This study introduces a methodology that models partial shading as an equivalent reduction in solar insolation across the entire panel. 
      The model was derived from empirical data gathered under various shading scenarios, and curve-fitting techniques were employed to establish an empirical relationship 
      between shading patterns and power loss. The proposed model was experimentally validated on a rooftop PV system in Bengaluru, India, and demonstrated precise predictions 
      of power loss under different partial shading conditions. The framework presented can be adapted to accommodate location-specific variables, 
      providing a versatile tool for evaluating and optimizing PV system performance in partially shaded urban environments.

    <p>PV power penetration is increasing rapidly. Hence, its impact on the grid operation becomes a major concern for the utilities. Predictive models of renewable energy are an essential requirement  to  analyze  this  impact.  Design  of  an  accurate,  effective  and  powerful  model  for forecasting is a highly challenging task in weather dependent renewable energy sources. This paper  proposes  a  novel  modular  Least  Square  SVM  (LS-SVM)  based  Regression  model  for solar-power  forecast.  The  solar  power  is  calculated  using  predicted  value  of  solar  irradiance. This method highly reduces the computation complexity and time. The proposed model uses a Time-Series  decoupling  strategy  where  instead  oftreating the historical  data  as  a  single  time series, the data is split into multiple time series. Each time series carries the historical data of solar irradiance at a particular time of the day during the period under consideration. The model has shown promising results with a MAPE of 3.5% for a day ahead prediction</p>

    <p>All over the world, penetration of solar PV in electrical grids has seen a steep increase in the last decade. This includes both low power solar 
      roof top installations and large-scale solar farms. Consciousness about climate change and encouraging government policies especially in developing 
      countries have made investment in solar PV farms an attractive option for private investors. Further large amount of infertile land in tropical countries 
      has also boosted installation of PV farms in such spaces. Two important decisions for any PV system are the space required for panel installation and the 
      cost incurred. The cost depends on the type of installation. Popular models are standalone PV micro grid, 
      large farms and that are grid-tied and those that are not tied to the grid. Based on the model, the required power electronics has to be designed. 
      Currently, there are no open-source design tool to help the consumer/investor to design the specifications and ratings of different components. 
      In this paper, a unique and a novel GUI is presented to design the entire solar PV systems. Further break-up of cost components, 
      standards and configuration for inverters are also presented in the GUI.</p>
