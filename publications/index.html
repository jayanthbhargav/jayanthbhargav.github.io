    <p>Mixed-Observable Markov Decision Processes (MOMDPs) are used to model systems where the state space can be decomposed as a product space of a set of state variables, 
      and the controlling agent is able to measure only a subset of those state variables. In this paper, we consider the setting where we have a set of potential sensors to 
      select for the MOMDP, where each sensor measures a certain state variable and has a selection cost. We formulate the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors for MOMDPs 
      (subject to certain budget constraints) to maximize the expected infinite-horizon reward of the agent and show that this sensor placement problem is NP-Hard, even when one has 
      access to an oracle that can compute the optimal policy for any given instance. We then study a greedy algorithm for approximate optimization and show that there exist instances 
      of the MOMDP sensor selection problem where the greedy algorithm can perform arbitrarily poorly. Finally, we provide some empirical results of greedy sensor selection over 
      randomly generated MOMDP instances and show that, in practice, the greedy algorithm provides near-optimal solutions for many cases, despite the fact that one cannot provide 
      general theoretical guarantees for its performance. In total, our work establishes fundamental complexity results for the problem of optimal sensor selection 
      (at design-time) for MOMDPs. </p>

    <p>Planning an accurate and safe trajectory is a crucial element in autonomous driving. To execute complex driving maneuvers like overtaking, 
      motion planning requires an enhanced decision-making algorithm that decides the when, where and how of the overtaking maneuver. 
      This paper proposes an algorithm that increases the likelihood of a safe overtaking maneuver by 
      learning spatial information. Here, spatial information refers to the track portion/curve and the position of the ego vehicle with reference to that. 
      The technique is applied to an autonomous racing setup where vehicles have to detect and operate at the limits of dynamic handling. 
      To learn the spatial information, offline experiments of a 2-player race are conducted to generate probability distributions of overtaking maneuvers 
      conditioned on speed and relative-position of the ego vehicle with respect to the opponent. 
      Furthermore, a Switched Model Predictive Contouring Controller (SMPCC) is proposed for incorporating the policy learning algorithm into the path planning 
      and control setup. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve an increased number of overtakes at different track portions
      on known and unknown race tracks. </p>

    <p>The rising popularity of driver-less cars has led
to the research and development in the field of autonomous
racing, and overtaking in autonomous racing is a challenging
task. Vehicles have to detect and operate at the limits of dynamic
handling and decisions in the car have to be made at high
speeds and high acceleration. One of the most crucial parts in
autonomous racing is path planning and decision making for an
overtaking maneuver with a dynamic opponent vehicle. In this
paper we present the evaluation of a track based offline policy
learning approach for autonomous racing. We define specific
track portions and conduct offline experiments to evaluate the
probability of an overtaking maneuver based on speed and
position of the ego vehicle. Based on these experiments we can
define overtaking probability distributions for each of the track
portions. Further, we propose a switching MPCC controller setup
for incorporating the learnt policies to achieve a higher rate
of overtaking maneuvers. By exhaustive simulations, we show
that our proposed algorithm is able to increase the number of
overtakes at different track portions. </p>

<p> Rooftop PV systems are now becoming ubiquitous with the reduction in costs of PV panels and related technologies. Developing countries like India have undertaken Green Energy Transition to ensure sustainability and energy self-sufficiency. The increase in consumer participation in view of the nation's goal necessitates technology advancements in condition monitoring of PV systems. As of today, state of art and robust monitoring systems are available and deployed for large solar farms and have proved to increase the operational efficiency of those systems, whereas there are no standard monitoring systems for small-scale installations. This paper presents a survey on Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of PV systems and an IoT based Wireless Sensor Network for PV panel monitoring.</p>

    <p> Stand-alone PV systems are increasingly becoming popular as a viable alternative to utility power supply, especially in remote corners, where accessibility is a problem to deploy conventional distribution systems. It is also becoming a choice of conscious consumers who wish to contribute to environment protection through use of green energy. In this context, it is vital to have a fault diagnosis system in place to identify various faults in the PV system. This paper presents a signature analysis of various electrical faults in a stand-alone PV system, with battery storage. The focus of the work is to minimize the sensors to be deployed for detection and classification of the faults.

    <p> Micro controller contains one or more processor cores along with peripheral devices and memory. Micro-controllers find extensive use in embedded system applications such as automobile engine control systems, bio-medical devices, electronic appliances, etc. They are specific to a particular task, are small and compact in size, and consume less power; all of these features have resulted in the ubiquitous deployment of micro-controllers in various devices. However, it must be noted that a microcontroller is a Control Circuit, and not a Driving Circuit. This statement is supported by the fact that the output current of a microcontroller is too small to drive a motor connected to it directly; in fact, this is an unpropitious experiment and can damage the microcontroller. The microcontroller controls the working of actuators connected to it by following the logic coded onto it, and in this sense, forms the very brain of the embedded system. But in order to drive the motor, we need a type of switch (MOSFET, Relay, etc.) which can take the small output current of the microcontroller and control the power source to the motor. Essentially, a microcontroller accepts real-time inputs and generates an output control signal as per the rules and predefined logical deductions, in the prescribed algorithm. This paper discusses the criterion one must consider for the choice of an embedded system from the plethora of systems available in the market and the choice of control technique for different robotic applications.</p>      </span>

    <p>PV power penetration is increasing rapidly. Hence, its impact on the grid operation becomes a major concern for the utilities. Predictive models of renewable energy are an essential requirement  to  analyze  this  impact.  Design  of  an  accurate,  effective  and  powerful  model  for forecasting is a highly challenging task in weather dependent renewable energy sources. This paper  proposes  a  novel  modular  Least  Square  SVM  (LS-SVM)  based  Regression  model  for solar-power  forecast.  The  solar  power  is  calculated  using  predicted  value  of  solar  irradiance. This method highly reduces the computation complexity and time. The proposed model uses a Time-Series  decoupling  strategy  where  instead  oftreating the historical  data  as  a  single  time series, the data is split into multiple time series. Each time series carries the historical data of solar irradiance at a particular time of the day during the period under consideration. The model has shown promising results with a MAPE of 3.5% for a day ahead prediction</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>All over the world, penetration of solar PV in electrical grids has seen a steep increase in the last decade. This includes both low power solar 
      roof top installations and large-scale solar farms. Consciousness about climate change and encouraging government policies especially in developing 
      countries have made investment in solar PV farms an attractive option for private investors. Further large amount of infertile land in tropical countries 
      has also boosted installation of PV farms in such spaces. Two important decisions for any PV system are the space required for panel installation and the 
      cost incurred. The cost depends on the type of installation. Popular models are standalone PV micro grid, 
      large farms and that are grid-tied and those that are not tied to the grid. Based on the model, the required power electronics has to be designed. 
      Currently, there are no open-source design tool to help the consumer/investor to design the specifications and ratings of different components. 
      In this paper, a unique and a novel GUI is presented to design the entire solar PV systems. Further break-up of cost components, 
      standards and configuration for inverters are also presented in the GUI.</p>
